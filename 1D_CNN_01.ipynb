    "A convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet), as we have already learned, is an artificial neural network. CNNs are used in numerous modern artificial intelligence technologies, primarily in the machine processing of image or audio data. Basically, the structure of a classic convolutional neural network consists of one or more convolutional layers, followed by a pooling layer and a fully-connected layer. In principle, this unit can be repeated as often as desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "By learning and applying features (training), it is possible to recognize patterns and objects through the network. Higher layers use the data of lower layers, so that even more complex patterns can be recognized. "

    "\n",
    "The first tutorial about CNNs ('Simple convolutional neural network for handdrawn digit recognition in Keras') focused on a two dimensional convolutional neural network, which is especially suitable for image recognition problems. One dimensional convolutional neural network, on the other hand, are more commonly used for natural language processing (NLP) or analysis of time sequences of sensor data. Other or more specific examples could be audio signals, gyroscope or accelerometer data. "

    "### What are the differences between 1D and 2D CNNs?<a id=\"What_are_the_differences_between_1D_and_2D_CNNs\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs, whether 1D, 2D or 3D CNNs, share the same properties and approach. The biggest difference is the dimensionality of the input data and the way the filters, also known as convolution kernel or feature detector, used move across the data. Below is a sample visualization of the data processing of a 1D CNN compared to a 2D CNN. The illustration is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the different processing methods using examples:  \n",
    "\n",
    "![1D CNN and 2D CNN - Examples](img/1Dcnn_vs_2Dcnn.png \"1D CNN and 2D CNN - Examples\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanatory note:** In the graphic on the left we see an example for NLP (example for 1D CNN). The set consists of six parts, each represented by a vector. The feature detector always covers the complete word, where the height of the Detector determines how many components of a sentence are taken into account during training. In this example, the height is two and the feature detector would iterate five times over the data. \n",
    "On the right side we see the example of a 2D CNN based on computer vision. Each pixel of the image is defined by an x and a y position. In addition, each pixel also contains the three values for RGB. The feature detector in this case has a dimension of 2x2. As suggested in the graphic, the feature detector moves horizontally and vertically across the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above-mentioned examples of the use of 1D CNNs already show that they are very effective in extracting characteristics from a fixed-length segment of the entire data set. However, it should not be too important in the evaluation where the characteristics are located in the segment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between 2D and 1D CNNs is that 1D networks allow the use of larger filter sizes. This means that if a 1D CNN uses a size 7 filter, it has only seven feature vectors, whereas a 2D CNN with a filter size of 7 would have 49 feature vectors, making it a very broad selection. Also, with 1D CNNs, you can use larger convolution windows. A small example: In a 2D convolution layer that uses a 3x 3 convolution window, nine feature vectors (3x3=9) are used. With a 1D convolution layer, a window of size 3 contains only three feature vectors, which means you can afford a window size of 7 or 9 easily.  "

    "To make the graphic even more understandable, a few additions to the individual layers. Each input is a matrix defined by height and width. The \"height\" is the length of a data set that is fed into the network. It is also called the input height. The \"width\" or also called depth is the width of a data set that is fed into the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling is divided into average, mean and max pooling. Pooling layers have the advantage that they reduce the variance, increase the calculation performance, offer possibilities to create deeper networks, which in turn can solve more complex tasks and are a preventive measure against overfitting.\n",
    "Most often, though, 1D CNNs use max pooling. How the max pooling works is described in the figure. Average pooling works roughly as follows: It counts everything and then flows to the next layer, which means that all values are actually used for feature mapping and output - which is a very generalized calculation. If we don't need all inputs from the conv layer, we get a poor accuracy for the average pooling. However, it is well suited for object localization. Since mean pooling has proven to be less relevant and efficient, we won't go into that further.  "

    "The images `Compromise Plot` and `Compromise Prediction` are taken from the notebook `31_Neural_Networks_IMDB` [[4]](#r4) and should serve as validation of our model.\n",
    "If we compare the plots, we only see a slightly different distribution of the prediction values. The model from this notebook had more negative reviews than the model from notebook 31_Neural_Networks_IMDB. Which of the models makes the better prediction cannot be seen from the plot diagram. In both cases, the first 10 incorrectly marked reviews were checked. It is noticeable that our model makes a less \"wrong\" prediction than the model from the notebook 31_Neural_Networks_IMDB. However, since this value is not extremely different, it cannot be assumed that our model is actually a more suitable model. Both models could be improved by optimizations. In addition, both are simple examples. It should also be noted that the value moves back and forth within a certain range. This means that if the notebook is run through again, the model may perform worse, but also much better. The same is true for the other model. Therefore it is often the case in the AI area that several models are trained at the same time to find the best of all models."
